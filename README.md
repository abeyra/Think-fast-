# Think-fast-

## Introduction 

"Think Fast" is a web application inspired by "Wordle" where users try to guess a five letter word and have six 
attempts to do so. This game forces users to think critically and helps to sharpen both their vocabulary and their
cognitive ability. "Think Fast" has an extra layer of difficulty added to it because there is a ten-minute timer 
that starts when the game begins and if the user doesn't guess the word correctly before the timer expires they 
will lose automatically.
